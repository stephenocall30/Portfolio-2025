        <h2>Context & Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Urgent and Emergency Care (UEC) spans 111 online/telephony, Clinical Assessment Services, GP out-of-hours, urgent treatment centres, and emergency departments. Because these services run on different systems, clinicians rarely see a complete picture of a patient‚Äôs recent encounters.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result: patients repeat their story at multiple touchpoints; clinicians piece together context from partial records; opportunities to spot deterioration, unmet needs, or patterns (e.g. frequent attendances) are harder to identify.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Objectives & Constraints</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide a consolidated, chronological view of encounters with fast filtering by date, setting, and type.</li>
          <li>Support clinical decision‚Äëmaking without adding cognitive load to high‚Äëpressure workflows.</li>
          <li>Align with NHS service standards, accessibility (WCAG 2.2) and clinical safety expectations.</li>
          <li>Explore integration paths with regional shared care records.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Constraints included fragmented data sources (e.g. 111 Repeat Caller Service only covers 111 telephony), gaps for GP out‚Äëof‚Äëhours and ED, and varied information governance across regions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          We spoke with <strong>19 patients</strong> who had recently used 111 and <strong>40 UEC professionals</strong> (from frontline clinicians to programme and technical leads) across England.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Patients:</strong> Most prioritised effective care over privacy concerns and expected clinicians to ‚Äúalready have their information‚Äù. Those with complex needs were most frustrated by repeating details.</li>
          <li><strong>Clinicians:</strong> Encounter history was more useful later in the episode of care (e.g. CAS/ED) and always interpreted alongside other clinical information. Regional maturity varied; some areas were close to solving this, others had little provision.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <h3>Discover</h3>
        <p>
          Mapped the UEC data landscape (encounters vs episodes), identified boundary/integration gaps, and prioritised moments where encounter history adds the most value.
        </p>

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>
          Produced a <strong>service blueprint</strong> showing when and how encounter history should surface; created low‚Äëfidelity Figma prototypes focused on rapid scan, sorting, and filtering. Content design emphasised plain language and clear time/place cues.
        </p>

        <h3>Validate</h3>
        <p>
          Ran clinician feedback sessions to refine hierarchy (e.g. encounter type prominence, referral indicators) and interactions. Explored alignment with regional shared care record initiatives.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Outcomes & Impact</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Delivered a validated prototype and <strong>reusable patterns</strong> for encounter history in UEC contexts.</li>
          <li>Informed national interoperability planning by highlighting governance/integration blockers and pragmatic sequencing.</li>
          <li>Provided groundwork for more nuanced ‚Äúrepeat caller‚Äù triggers and trend detection.</li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Technology alone doesn‚Äôt fix the visibility gap: progress depends on governance, regional collaboration, and alignment with shared care records. The design challenge was balancing <strong>speed, clarity, and safety</strong> for time‚Äëcritical use.
