          <h2>Context & Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Palcic Taekwondo had built a strong reputation through decades of martial arts training, but its visual identity was inconsistent. Logos varied across uniforms, certificates, posters, and social media, with no clear colour palette or typography standards. The brand needed a refresh that would honour tradition while appealing to modern audiences.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Objectives & Constraints</h2>
          <p>
            The objective was to design a brand identity that could be scaled for use on everything from social media icons to large banners, while retaining clarity and impact in black‚Äëand‚Äëwhite applications such as certificates and newspaper ads. Constraints included retaining certain traditional visual cues (e.g., Taekwondo belt colours) and ensuring designs worked in low‚Äëcost printing scenarios.

          <h2>Process</h2>
          <h3>Discover</h3>
          <p>
            Held brand workshops with instructors and senior students to uncover core values, personality traits, and visual preferences. Analysed competitor branding to identify gaps and opportunities.

          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>
            Developed multiple logo concepts balancing abstract martial arts symbolism with clean, modern typography. Explored flexible layouts that could adapt for portrait/landscape formats, embroidered patches, and social avatars.
          </p>

          <h3>Deliver</h3>
          <p>
            Produced a complete brand kit including master logo files, monochrome variations, colour palette, and typography guidelines. Created print‚Äëready templates for certificates, posters, and event banners, as well as optimised digital assets for web and social media.
